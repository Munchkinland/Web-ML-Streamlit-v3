üìù Instructions

Step 1: Train a New Model or Use the One from the Previous Project
In the deployment module with Flask, we explored a dataset and trained a model that was subsequently used in a web application developed in Flask and deployed on Render. In this project, you can either use the same model and only change the web application, or find another dataset and train a new model.

Step 2: Develop a Web Application Using Streamlit
With the skills acquired in this module, develop an interface to utilize the model. Style it as you see fit and note any external resources you have used for development.

Step 3: Integrate the Model and the Application on Render
Create a free service on Render and integrate the work you have done to deploy the web application online. Don't forget to include the link to the service in your repository.
